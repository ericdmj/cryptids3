### Description:

A full-stack app based on ArcGIS Online for capturing cryptid sightings in the U.S.

I wanted to keep the map as clean as possible, so I decided to make virtually all the widgets expandable and put them in their collapsed state except for the Editor, since the main point of this project is for people to be able to capture their cryptid sightings.

I did create a filter and tweaked it so it could show a huge list of cryptid names: users can select an individual cryptid to see how many of that particular kind are on the map.

The icons (symbols) are only the five principle cryptid body types because creating an icon for each of hundreds of cryptids is rather a daunting proposition.

Happy entering--please add as many as you'd like!

(One final note: I have noticed that sometimes I have to reload the site to get it to display right, but I think that's because of my super-horrible hotel wifi. But I thought I should mention it!)
